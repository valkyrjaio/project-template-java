# Project Template (Java)

A starter template for creating new Java repositories in the Valkyrjaio
organization.

This template ships with the full Valkyrja CI pipeline pre-wired (commit-message
check, trailing-newline check), a minimal Gradle setup, and the repository
conventions used across the rest of the org. Use it as the starting point for any
new Java package or integration repo — not for end-user applications built on the
Valkyrja framework (use [`valkyrja-starter-app-java`][starter url] for that).

Usage
-----

### Use this template _(recommended)_

This repository is a GitHub template. Click the **Use this template** button
at the top of the repo to create a new repository in the Valkyrjaio
organization, pre-populated with the template's structure and CI.

### After Creating Your Repo

1. Update `build.gradle.kts` with your package's artifact ID, description, and
   GitHub URL
2. Update `settings.gradle.kts` with your project name
3. Replace the contents of `src/` with your package's source code
4. Update this `README.md` to describe the new package
5. Configure the required secrets and variables — see
   [`REPOSITORY_NAMING.md`][repository naming url] for naming guidance and
   `.github`'s workflow documentation for secret requirements
6. Verify CI passes on the first commit

What's Included
---------------

- **CI pipeline** — the same commit-message and trailing-newline checks used
  across every Valkyrjaio repo
- **Gradle configuration** — `build.gradle.kts` with Maven Central publishing
  and signing, matching the org convention
- **Repository conventions** — aligned with
  [`REPOSITORY_NAMING.md`][repository naming url] and
  [`VOCABULARY.md`][vocabulary url]

Versioning and Release Process
------------------------------

This template follows [semantic versioning][semantic versioning url] with a
